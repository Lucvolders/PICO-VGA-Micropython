Hello Luc,

I looked back in my archives and found an example with fonts. At the time I generated 3 different fonts, stored as 3 different .py pieces of code. You'll find in the provided exampe how to incorporate these in the main program (basically 5 more funtions added:

    setfont(numfont)
    settextcursor(x position ,y position)
    settextcolor(color)
    printh(string to be printed on screen)
    drawchar(character)

I didn't retest recently this piece of code, so you might have to debug a little, but it was working quite well. Of course, loading a font in memory reduces even more the available RAM, so you would definetly not want to use this pico for complex programming (butfor display only it would be fine !)

I posted the code in a separate folder.

Have a great day !

Hugh
